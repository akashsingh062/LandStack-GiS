## Problem Statement (Original)

> **Source**: Smart India Hackathon 2026 -- PS #26014

### Background

Land governance in India involves multiple institutions maintaining land-related information in fragmented and disconnected systems. Core datasets such as cadastral maps, Record of Rights (RoR), registration records, land use information, Master Plan, Building Permission, Restrictions, property taxation records, utility infrastructure, and other land-related databases are often managed independently by different departments and agencies with limited interoperability. This results in duplication of effort, inconsistencies in records, delays in obtaining ownership information, lack of transparency in transactions, and inconvenience to citizens seeking land-related services.

The growing scale of urbanization, increasing land transactions, demand for efficient governance, and the need for transparent and citizen-centric public service delivery require a modern digital approach to land administration. With advances in GIS technologies, Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), cloud computing, interoperable APIs, AI/ML analytics, and geospatial standards, there is an opportunity to transform land governance through a unified digital ecosystem. Land Stack is envisaged as an integrated GIS-based digital platform that brings together all land-related datasets, workflows, and services into a single interoperable framework. Built upon georeferenced cadastral maps and linked with Record of Rights (land ownership records), Land Stack can serve as foundational digital infrastructure for efficient land governance, informed decision making, improved service delivery. The proposed platform should support both rural and urban contexts and enable seamless coordination across departments, institutions, and citizen interfaces.

### Detailed Description

The Department of Land Resources has initiated the development and deployment of Land Stack in pilot locations of Chandigarh and Tamil Nadu, launched on 31 December 2025. Following successful implementation, the platform is proposed to be expanded across India by covering one city and one village in every State and Union Territory, and subsequently scaled to achieve nationwide coverage. One of the major challenges in India is that land is a State subject, resulting in significant diversity in land administration systems across states. Variations exist in land record formats, database structures, units of measurement, number and type of fields, language, terminology, and administrative workflows.

Therefore, the challenge is to conceptualize and develop a scalable prototype of Land Stack capable of integrating diverse land-related datasets, workflows, and services into a common interoperable State-level framework.

The proposed Land Stack solution should organize information into three broad categories of spatial layers. The base layer should comprise georeferenced cadastral maps, parcel boundaries, and unique parcel identifiers such as ULPIN.

This foundational layer should provide the spatial framework upon which all governance and service-related datasets can be integrated. The essential layers should include core governance datasets linked to each parcel, such as Record of Rights (RoR), registration data, master plans, building permissions and approvals, encumbrance and mortgage records, land use and zoning information. These layers should collectively define ownership, rights, restrictions, liabilities, and permissible land use associated with each parcel. Beyond this, additional or use-case layers should extend the platform's governance and citizen service capabilities by integrating datasets such as utility infrastructure, property taxation records, valuation references, infrastructure networks, environmental or restriction zones, and other service linkages. Each land parcel should be uniquely identifiable and linked with multiple layers of governance and administrative information, with ULPIN serving as the suggested common identifier. The prototype should demonstrate integration of multiple land-related domains through parcel-level GIS visualization and data exploration tools. The system should support interoperability between departmental systems through open APIs, standardized metadata structures, secure authentication mechanisms, role-based access controls, audit trails, and scalable digital architecture. Citizen-facing capabilities such as parcel search, ownership verification, transaction status tracking, service requests, and access to land-related information should also be incorporated.

Participants are encouraged to integrate innovative technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), satellite imagery-based change detection, predictive analytics, workflow automation, and decision-support dashboards to improve transparency, operational efficiency, and governance outcomes. The overall solution should be modular, scalable, configurable for different administrative contexts, and capable of serving as a replicable national framework for integrated digital land governance.

### Expected Solution

The expected outcome is a functional prototype demonstrating the concept of Land Stack as an integrated GIS-based Digital Public Infrastructure for land governance. The solution should provide a unified digital platform capable of integrating multiple land-related datasets around a parcel-centric spatial framework and enabling seamless interaction between governance institutions, land administration agencies, and citizens. The prototype should demonstrate GIS-based parcel visualization, integration of mock or sample land-related datasets, role-based administrative dashboards, citizen-facing service interfaces, and interoperable workflows between land records, registration, dispute, planning, and fiscal systems.

The proposed solution should showcase efficient parcel-level information access, real-time or simulated workflow integration, cross-departmental data interoperability, analytics-driven governance insights, and transparent citizen service delivery mechanisms. Innovative solutions that leverage AI/ML, geospatial intelligence, predictive analytics, workflow automation, API-based integration, mobile accessibility, and secure cloud-native architecture will be preferred.

The final prototype should demonstrate how fragmented land governance systems can be transformed into a unified, scalable, transparent, and citizen-centric Land Stack platform capable of improving land administration, enabling citizens to take informed decisions, accelerating transactions, strengthening planning, and enabling data-driven governance.

Further, participants are expected to prepare a Standard Technical Document containing details of API standards, interoperability standards, data schemas, system architecture, GIS standards, security frameworks, UI/UX guidelines, color schemas, and deployment and scalability considerations.

## What is LandStack?

LandStack is a **parcel-centric platform** -- meaning everything revolves around a single land parcel.

Think of it this way: pick any piece of land in India. Right now, its ownership record sits with the Revenue department, its registration deed is with the Sub-Registrar, its tax record is with the Municipal body, its building permission is with the Planning department, and its map is with the Survey department. None of these systems talk to each other.

LandStack **brings all of that information together** on a single map, linked to a single parcel, accessible through a single interface. A citizen can search for a parcel and see everything about it -- who owns it, what restrictions apply, what taxes are due, whether there are disputes, what the zoning allows. An officer can verify records across departments without leaving the platform.

---

## How Does It Work?

The platform is built around four core ideas:

1. **Parcel is the center of everything.**
   Every record in the system (ownership, tax, dispute, building permit) is linked to a specific parcel. The parcel has a unique internal ID (UUID) and can also carry a ULPIN.

2. **Three data layers** (matching the problem statement):
   - **Base Layer** -- Cadastral maps, parcel boundaries, ULPIN identifiers
   - **Essential Layer** -- RoR, registrations, encumbrances, building permissions, land use, zoning
   - **Use-Case Layer** -- Property tax, disputes, utility infrastructure, environmental zones, circle rates

3. **State Adapters** handle the diversity problem.
   Bihar calls its land record "Jamabandi" and measures land in "Decimal/Katha". Tamil Nadu calls it "Chitta/Adangal" and measures in "Hectare/Cent". Our adapter framework takes each state's format and normalizes it into one common schema -- so the rest of the platform doesn't need to know which state the data came from.

4. **Role-based interfaces.**
   Citizens, Land Officers, and Admins each see a different view of the platform suited to their needs.

## What Have We Built?

### For Citizens
- **Parcel Search** -- search by ULPIN, survey number, or keyword
- **Land 360 View** -- a single page showing all records associated with a parcel (ownership, RoR, registration, encumbrances, tax, building permissions, land use, disputes, restrictions)
- **Interactive Profile Dashboard** -- modern layout displaying identity credentials, real land portfolios showing full Jamabandi RoR, active service applications, and security ledgers with thematic tabs.
- **Service Requests** -- apply for ownership verification, encumbrance certificates, mutations, and other services online (publicly accessible, login required for submission)
- **Application Tracking** -- track the status of submitted applications through targeted tracking search
- **Multi-language Support** -- switch the UI language

### For Land Officers
- **Officer Dashboard** -- manage assigned parcels, review conflicts, process workflows
- **Conflict Resolution** -- view deterministic rule-flagged data conflicts and resolve them
- **Workflow Management** -- statutory workflows with defined steps, preserving exact rejecting department and stage index across statutory workflows with SLA deadlines

### For Administrators
- **Admin Dashboard** -- system-wide management with strict RBAC hiding inaccessible links
- **Data Import** -- ingest new state data through the adapter framework
- **Security & Audit** -- view audit logs, manage user roles, monitor system health
- **Rules Intelligence** -- review conflict summaries and anomalies generated by the deterministic Rules Engine

### On the Map
- **Interactive GIS Map** -- parcels rendered on an interactive map using MapLibre GL with an updated UI
- **Risk Profile Engine** -- 12-category plot-level risk profile engine with interactive map inspection UI for ultra-clean readability and instant scanning
- **Spatial Queries** -- the map only loads parcels visible in the current viewport (bounding-box queries)
- **Layer Overlays** -- roads, water bodies, utility infrastructure, environmental zones, master plan zones
- **Click-to-Inspect** -- click any parcel on the map to open its Land 360 view

**Why these choices?**

- **Next.js** -- full-stack in one codebase. The frontend and API run together, which reduces deployment complexity.
- **MapLibre GL** -- open-source, no API key needed, renders thousands of parcels smoothly. No vendor lock-in compared to Google Maps or Mapbox.
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** -- the industry standard for GIS databases. PostGIS lets us run spatial queries (e.g., "find all parcels within this bounding box") directly in SQL, which is much faster than doing it in application code.
- **Supabase** -- managed PostgreSQL with PostGIS pre-installed. No need to set up our own database server.
- **Turf.js** -- for any spatial calculations on the client side (area computation, bounding boxes, etc.).
- **TypeScript** -- catches bugs before runtime and makes the codebase easier to maintain as a team.

## How is the Database Designed?

The database is organized into **five schemas**, each handling a distinct concern:

```text
PostgreSQL + PostGIS
│
├── gis              -- Spatial tables
│   ├── parcels              (the core entity -- everything links here)
│   ├── parcel_identifiers   (cross-department ID mapping)
│   ├── land_use_zones
│   ├── master_plan_zones
│   ├── restriction_zones
│   ├── roads, buildings, utility_networks, water_bodies
│   └── admin_boundaries     (State > District > Village hierarchy)
│
├── land             -- Land governance
│   ├── owners               (owner details)
│   ├── parcel_ownership     (many-to-many: one parcel can have multiple owners)
│   ├── ror_records          (Record of Rights -- Jamabandi/Chitta)
│   ├── mutations            (ownership changes)
│   ├── data_conflicts       (Rules-engine-flagged inconsistencies)
│   └── satellite_detections (change detection results)
│
├── governance       -- Departmental records
│   ├── registrations        (sale deeds, transfers)
│   ├── encumbrances         (mortgages, liens)
│   ├── building_permissions (construction approvals)
│   ├── property_tax         (tax assessment and payment)
│   ├── disputes             (court cases)
│   └── circle_rates         (valuation zone rates)
│
├── metadata         -- Data provenance
│   ├── data_sources         (where data came from)
│   ├── data_lineage         (field-level source tracking)
│   └── state_adapters       (adapter configs, stored as JSONB)
│
└── audit            -- Accountability
    ├── audit_logs           (who did what, when, with full diff)
    └── users                (user accounts and roles)
```

**Key design decisions:**

- The internal primary key is a UUID (`parcel_id`), not ULPIN. ULPIN is stored separately and is nullable because not all pilot data has it assigned yet.
- Owners and parcels have a many-to-many relationship (handles joint ownership).
- All geometry columns use `MultiPolygon` and have GIST spatial indexes for fast queries.
- Every change is tracked in `audit.audit_logs` with a JSONB diff of what changed.
- `metadata.data_lineage` tracks which department/source each field value came from.

## What Data Are We Using?

We have pilot data for **three states**: Bihar, Chandigarh, and Tamil Nadu.

The data uses **authentic governance record structures** (real field names, real formats, real hierarchies) but with **synthetic geometry and values** for the prototype. This means the data schemas match what a real deployment would use, but no real citizen data is in the system.

### Bihar Pilot (30 parcels -- our primary demo)

| Layer | What it contains |
|---|---|
| **Base** | 30 cadastral parcels (GeoJSON), ULPIN index, data conflict registry |
| **Essential** | Jamabandi RoR, registration records, encumbrances, building permissions, land use, zoning/master plan |
| **Use-Case** | Property tax, disputes, circle rates, utility connections, utility infrastructure, roads, water bodies, environmental zones, rules-based conflict summaries |

### Chandigarh and Tamil Nadu

Same three-layer structure with their own state-specific field names and formats. Each state's data is normalized through its adapter before entering the common database.

### Pan-India Reference

Administrative boundary hierarchy (State > District > Sub-district) for all States and UTs, used for search and navigation.

---

## How Do State Adapters Work?

This is one of our key innovations. Since land is a State subject, every state has different terminology:

| Concept | Bihar | Tamil Nadu | Chandigarh |
|---|---|---|---|
| Land record name | Jamabandi / Khatiyan | Chitta / Adangal / Patta | Property Register |
| Survey number field | khesra_number | survey_number | property_id |
| Owner name field | raiyat_name | pattadar_name | owner_name |
| Area unit | Decimal / Katha | Hectare / Cent | Square Yards |
| Admin hierarchy | Zila > Anchal > Mauza | District > Taluk > Village | Sector > Block |

Our **State Adapter Framework** solves this:
1. Each state has a registered adapter with its field mappings and unit conversions.
2. When data comes in from a state, the adapter translates it into our canonical (common) schema.
3. The rest of the platform works with the canonical schema only -- it doesn't need to know Bihar says "raiyat_name" while Tamil Nadu says "pattadar_name".
4. Adding a new state means writing a new adapter config -- no changes to the core platform.

Currently registered adapters: **Bihar (BR)**, **Tamil Nadu (TN)**, **Chandigarh (CH)**.

---

## Rules Engine & Risk Profiling

We have replaced the initial AI/ML mockups with a robust, deterministic **Rules Engine** (`rules-engine.ts`) to ensure accuracy, consistency, and compliance with strict governance standards.

| Module | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Conflict Engine** | Cross-references records to find overlapping or contradictory data | Flags a parcel where the registered area is 500 sq.m but the RoR says 2000 sq.m |
| **Risk Profile Engine** | 12-category plot-level risk profile evaluating the safety and legality of a parcel | Assesses risk factors like environmental restrictions, zoning conflicts, and active disputes |
| **Statutory Workflow Engine** | Enforces exact stage transitions, rejecting department tracking, and SLAs | Ensures an encumbrance certificate application follows the legally mandated approval steps |

---

## How is Security Handled?

| Concern | How we handle it |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth with session-based login, complemented by OTP Verification (`otp-service.ts`) with support for full 6-digit OTP clipboard paste and mobile autocomplete |
| **Authorization** | Advanced Role-Based Access Control (`rbac-matrix.ts`) and dynamic Attribute-Based Access Control via `policy-engine.ts` |
| **Route Protection** | A robust `RouteGuard` component and `route-guard.ts` intercepts invalid role access |
| **PII Masking** | Dedicated `pii-masker.ts` algorithmically masks sensitive identity information based on viewer's clearance |
| **Audit Trail** | Centralized `audit-logger.ts` logs every data change with actor, action, timestamp, and a full diff |
| **Input Validation** | Centralized sanitization via `input-validator.ts` |
| **Rate Limiting** | Endpoint abuse prevention via `rate-limiter.ts` |
| **Threat Detection** | Monitoring endpoints evaluating active threats and access patterns |
